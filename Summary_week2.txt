WEEK 2 – DATA STRUCTURES & FUNCTIONS
============================================================
What We Covered:
- Built-in collections: lists (ordered), tuples (immutable), sets (unique), dictionaries (key/value).
- When to use each structure and common operations (add, update, search).
- Functions: defining, parameters, return values, defaults, unpacking.
- Reuse and modularity: creating and importing your own modules.
- Introduction to errors and safe coding: try/except/finally and specific exception types.

Why It Matters:
Real programs organize data. Choosing the right data structure makes your code faster,
clearer, and easier to change. Functions and modules let you build larger applications.  

Practical Highlights – You Can Now:
- Store and manage structured records (students, products, tasks) in Python data structures.
- Write reusable utility functions and import them across files.
- Handle bad input or missing files without crashing.

Catch-Up Plan:
1. Study list, dict, and function examples in slides.
2. Uncomment & run Week 2 code blocks.
3. Build the Phonebook App mini-project (dict + JSON + functions).
